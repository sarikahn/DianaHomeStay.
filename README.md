Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sarikahn/DianaHomeStay.git
cd DianaHomeStay

Import Database
Open database.sql in your preferred MySQL client and execute it to create the necessary database and tables.
Configure Database Connection

Open db_config.php and update the credentials:
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$dbname = "your_database_name";


Run Locally
Place the project inside your web server directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP), then navigate to http://localhost/DianaHomeStay/.
Submit a Booking or Inquiry
Visit the homepage, browse rooms, and use the contact form to test submissions.

Database Schema
The database.sql file defines the following table structure:

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    check_in DATE,
    check_out DATE,
    message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Enhancements (Future Work)
Security: Use prepared statements in PHP to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Admin Dashboard: Allow homestay owners to view/manage incoming bookings.
UX Improvements: Add AJAX-powered form submissions and real-time confirmations.
Email Notifications: Send email alerts when new bookings are submitted.
Modernization: Migrate to a modern stack (e.g., React front-end, Node.js backend, MongoDB) for scalability.
